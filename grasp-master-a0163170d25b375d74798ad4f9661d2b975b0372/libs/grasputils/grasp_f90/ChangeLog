	* version 0.2.6:
	* get_sizeof_time_t.c: the previous fix was not sufficient for 64-bit machines. Fixed that.

2014-01-06 F. Ducos <fabrice.ducos@univ-lille1.fr>
	* version 0.2.5:
	* get_sizeof_time_t.c: fixed a warning on a printf statement

2013-11-30 F. Ducos <fabrice.ducos@univ-lille1.fr>
	* version 0.2.4:
	* upgrade to allow for installation of several installations of
	the library depending on the Fortran compiler. The library will
	be installed in different subfolders depending on the compiler.

2013-11-30 F. Ducos <fabrice.ducos@univ-lille1.fr>
	* version 0.2.3:
	* mod_c_utils.f90: all c_int variables converted to c_size_t
	* mod_time_utils.f90: convert_string_to_time now makes a local
	copy of its fortran string argument for safe passing to C.

2013-11-29 F. Ducos <fabrice.ducos@univ-lille1.fr>
        * version 0.2.2: the size of time_t is not anymore assumed.
	It is determined by the tool get_sizeof_time_t at build time.
